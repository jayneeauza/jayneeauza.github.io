							<p>Attending a concert, a ballet, a play or any other performing arts presentation is a special occasion. To help you get the most enjoyment and satisfaction from attending such performances and to help others get the same benefit, the following suggestions on proper behavior at such events are offered. Observing them will greatly enhance the experience.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Come on time or better still, come with some minutes to spare. This will give you ample time to find your seat, browse through the program or playbill and settle down and become comfortable with the surroundings. If a late arrival is unavoidable, do not insist on going up to the front of the house in the midst of the performance. Wait at the rear and find your seat during intermission.</li>
								<li>Please make sure that all alarm watches, cellular phones, electric beepers are turned off or put on mute or vibra mode as these maye interfere with the sound system and the incessant “beep” is distracting.</li>
								<li>Try to avoid conversations, even in whispers during a performance. Save any comments until the end of the number. The conversational buzz may irritate the rest of the audience or may distract the performer.</li>
								<li>Avoid standing, moving around, fidgeting, finding your seat or exiting while a performance is going on.You owe the performing artists who have worked very hard to perfect their craft, the courtesy of your full attention. Children who are likely to become restless at such performances should not be brought at all. They are likely to annoy not only your seatmates but the artists as well.</li>
								<li>If you want to take photographs of the artists during a performance, s\it should be best to clear the matter with the show manager. Flash photography will divert the artist’s concentration.</li>
								<li>Do not scream or whistle. Appreciation is best expressed by shouts of “Bravo” at the very end of the performance or in between appropriate breaks. Strong and prolonged applause suggest to the performer that the audience wants an encore. Performers appreciate a responsive and appreciative audience.</li>
